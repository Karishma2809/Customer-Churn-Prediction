# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting customer churn using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, and accurately identifying customers at risk of leaving can enable effective retention strategies.

**Features**
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed data visualization and insights to understand churn patterns and key indicators.
**Feature Engineering:** Transformation and creation of meaningful features to improve model performance.
**Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more.
**Model Evaluation:** Use of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
****Deployment:** Deployment-ready code for integrating the churn prediction model into real-world systems.
